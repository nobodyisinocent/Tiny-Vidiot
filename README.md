# Tiny-Vidiot
Here are two versions of a very low profile vidiot module for Amiga !
Gerber files are available.
The Kicad project will be also available very soon.

# Why an another Vidiot <a name="1"></a>

THe schematics of the Tiny-Vidiot is the same as the one from Sukkopera, and so the same of the one from a1k.org.

So why ? Because we (Lolof, Seb132 and I) have decided to design the smallest Vidiot module ever made to allow us to install expansions into the Amiga with the smallest possible constraints.

To obtain the littlest pcb possible, the two followings thinks were decided:
  - Components are 0603 footprints,
  - The Tiny-Vidiot pcb is a four layers. One internal layer is for GND while the second internal layer is for VCC power signals.

# About the project files <a name="4"></a>

The complete project of this four layers PCB is available here for downloading.

The pcb has been designed with Kicad under Linux: https://www.kicad.org/

To make this pcb, I did not wear out the planet or try to reinvent the wheel... I simply used the Kicad project made by Sukkopera.

The Sukkopera project is available here:
https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenAmigaVideoHybrid

Available soon
